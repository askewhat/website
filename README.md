hello :)

steps to update web site:

1. open github desktop app
2. click 'fetch origin (this checks for updates on the remote repository)
3. click 'pull origin' if there are updates (this will only happen if someone else (who could it be) has made an update to web site OR if i have made update to web site from a different computer)
4. open the website directory in zed (it's located in ~/kateshaw/code/website)
5. open terminal
6. type 'serve' and press enter (this starts a local server to preview local changes)
7. make changes
8. once i am happy with changes, go to github app and click 'commit to main' with a message
9. click 'push origin' (ike thinks that's what it's called) (this will update the remote repository with my local changes)
10. refresh kateshaw.co frenetically to make sure changes are applied
