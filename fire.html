            <h2>Prompt: Something being set on fire</h2>

            <p>
                She lay on her back in a dwindling snatch of shade and listened
                to the cicadas wail. A cabbage moth flitted past, its flight
                path erratic and unsteady. It might topple right out of the air
                if she reached out and flicked it, but it didn’t come close
                enough to try. Unmoving, she watched it bumble past her to
                alight on the petal of one of the lilies, its white wings
                glaring against the deep, bruised purple of the flower. The
                petals lolled like thirsty tongues stretched out long in the
                hopes of catching a drop of rain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Listlessly, she reached for a nearby dandelion and tried to
                pluck it from the dirt. The weed held fast. Near the corners of
                her lips, muscles in the centers of her cheeks twitched in
                fleeting reference to a frown. Slowly she lifted upper back off
                the cool earth, propping herself up on her elbow. She considered
                the unassuming contender from higher ground. Its petals pricked
                outwards like shards of shattered sun into a circle nearly two
                inches across. The stem stood tall and straight under the weight
                of its spiked halo, unwavering under all that it carried. In
                spite of the heat of the day, of the month, a heat so
                unrelenting that it brought the entire city to its knees; a heat
                that wilted the pansies and the dahlias in the garden, that
                singed the leaves of the cucumber plants; a heat that slowed
                even the likes of her, so that by now she spent the afternoons
                lying placid and still on her back in the grass, waiting
                languorously for the marginal reprieve of evening — in spite of
                the heat, the dandelion held its ground, vibrant and erect.
            </p>
            <p>
                With one crooked finger she caressed the stem, tracing slowly
                down its smooth length to the place where it plunged into the
                earth. She pictured the vast network of roots that exploded
                downwards from that spot, fighting their way valiantly through
                soil and clay in service of the flower above the surface, every
                day advancing further and deeper into the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                She clamped her fist around the base of the stem and jerked,
                severing the earthly bloom from its forces below. Languidly, she
                lowered herself onto her back once again. The torn base of the
                dandelion’s stem was frayed and fibrous strands of its innards
                shot out at varying lengths. She felt a pulsing against the
                delicate skin where her fingerprints whorled, the throb of the
                cells in the stem as they marched tirelessly on, pushing the
                last of the water they’d sucked from their roots up, up, up to
                the blossom above. The stem was still firm with their efforts,
                resisting the process of decay even as it began its dark and
                silent creep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eyes fixed on her kill as she twirled it slowly between her
                fingertips, she reached her other hand into her pocket and
                pulled out a lighter. She snapped the flame to attention, kissed
                it to the bottom of the stem. It didn’t burn. Again, that
                flicker of movement in her cheeks, a hint of distaste. She moved
                the flame, touching it this time to the sharp yellow petals. An
                instant reaction: they recoiled from the heat, retracted,
                started to smoke.
